When a title is clicked on you will be able to view details of that selected movie. You will see the rating, year, genre, trailer, plot, and even recommended movies all from the TMDB api.

The search function of this application brings you to a landing page that displays 4 movie collections Marvel, DC, Disney, and Star Wars. I have used state and useEffect to dynamically update your search results for a more natural feel.

The user can also create and login to their account. When the use has logged in, they can then save movies to their watch list.

# Languages and Frameworks used

I used the Next.js framework to build this application. The application is also connected to a MySQL database which allows the user to create a user account. Other technologies used where HTML, CSS, and TMDB API for all the movie content. It is also fully mobile responsive.

# Things I learned

I am still fairly new to react and next.js frameworks so by building this application it has grown my knowledge of client-side rendering vs server-side rendering. I was also able to continue to learn and develop my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and working with API's.
