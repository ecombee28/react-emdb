This application uses the TMDB(The movie database) API together with all of its data. The home page displays trending movies, tv shows, popular movies, trending on Netflix's, and top-rated movies of all time.

When a title is clicked on you will be able to view details of that selected movie. You will see the rating, year, genre, trailer, plot, and even recommended movies all from the TMDB api.

The search function of this application brings you to a landing page that displays 4 movie collections Marvel, DC, Disney, and Star Wars. I have used state and useEffect to dynamically update your search results for a more natural feel.

The user can also create and login to their account. When the use has logged in, they can then save movies to their watch list.

# Languages and Frameworks used

I used React to build this application. The application is also connected to a MySQL database which allows the user to create a user account and store any movie or show to their watchlist. Other technologies used where HTML, CSS, Jest and React testing libary, and the TMDB API for all the movie content. It is also fully mobile responsive.

# Things I learned

The reason I chose to create this application is because I love movies and when I came across the IMDB api and began to think of all the things I could do with it. Now that this application is complete I have learned more about React like the importance of creating small re-usable components that are easily tested.
